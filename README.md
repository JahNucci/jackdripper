## Welcome JahNucci's Secure Minting DAPP.

You can mint MFT's from the JackDripper series here. The app clearly displays wallet address, supply of JackDrippers and the status of the sale.

This app collects no information, connects securely and will provide a good set of error descriptions if you happen to be connected improperly etc.

This will only mint NFT's from the JackDripper collection found here:
